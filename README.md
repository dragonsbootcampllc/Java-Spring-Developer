# Software.

* Software refers to a set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do and how to do it.
* It can include operating systems, applications, games, and more.
* Software can be either proprietary (i.e., owned and controlled by an individual or company) or open source (i.e.,
  freely available for use and modification by anyone).

## Software Engineering.
